# BookFriend
DualHacks -  DevPost Hackathon

## Inspiration

- To unlock the future of education, the stepping stone is to provide native support to the students. By native support I mean the Language help. 
- Students often struggle to comprehend extensive PDFs or eBooks efficiently, hindering effective learning. 
- Searching for specific information within vast Books/ebooks can be time-consuming and discouraging.  accurate responses, streamlining the search process and enhancing information retrieval.

My inspiration behind this project is to make education accessible and fun for everyone by making it more creative via **Book Friend**

## What it does

**Book Friend** is built on **4** features:
- _Audio Book Expert_- This feature has 5 language supports where Students can search for any question within the book and turn it into Audio.
- _Text Summarizer_- Can Summarizer the entire book or eBook for you. Allowing students/learners to focus on key points and relevant information.
- QueryBot- This is a Feedback bot that helps students to ask any question within the book. Be more creative with prompts to get better results. 
- Book recommender- Gives recommendations on books based on Students' Interests. 

## How we built it

I built this project using 5 main components:
- LangChain - Powerful framework to integrate LLMs.
- ElevenLabs API - To convert text to audio
- OpenAIEmbeddings - Convert PDF text into Vectors
- VectorDB - To store PDF content and user for similarity search for student query in QueryBot feature
- Streamlit - An amazing UI framework to host and deploy Data Science and AI Projects.

## Challenges we ran into

- Parsing the PDF text into the Vector embeddings and using it for the query was one challenging part. 
- Also implementing 4 AI-based features in one project is a challenge in itself. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- I successfully implemented all the features. All the features are end-to-end. And I feel proud to have integrated 4 AI Features in one single project. 

## What we learned

- I learnt how to use tools such as Langchain and more about Vector Databases and its use case. 

## What's next for Book Friend

Integrating Fun-based learning by integrating Adapting learning.
